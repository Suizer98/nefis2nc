How available are the necessary data?

In winds.dat:

surface wind inputs: 10 stations, fairly broadly distributed.

then a sounding wind speed ( utm 569000  4173000 )
a sounding at the same location, labeled JU230512.OAK, sounds a lot like
oakland airport?  second sounding has temp, Td, and pressure
And the wind data is repeated...

 - http://www.esrl.noaa.gov/ might provide the sounding data

ds=xr.open_dataset('raob_soundings25653.cdf',decode_times=0)

- nice! - it has twice daily sondes.  just picked a random period in spring 2013,
  and got 150 profiles.

- plotting the wind vectors on top of the terrain, it looks pretty reasonable.

Questions before this could be put into place for our runs:
 - how much wind data can we get, starting with WY2013?
 - assume that the sonde profiles can be interpolated in time without too much
   trouble.
 - would have to downsample the gridded wind for input to suntans.  probably
   okay. going to be a big dataset.
 - aim for 1h winds?  3h?  using the sample setup as an example, one realization
   of the output wind field is 130kB.  So a year at 3h is 194 MB.  No sweat.
   Possible that 1km is too coarse for a place like Carquinez, but do we
   really need perfect wind there?
