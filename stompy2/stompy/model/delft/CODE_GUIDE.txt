Just some notes on coding style decisions and rationale (or complaints/quandaries)

Use tuples for class default values
--
When it's necessary for a class, such as Scenario, to have a default value expressed
as a list, use a tuple rather than a list.  This reduces errors in which method
code modifies the classes value.  In particular,
  class A(object):
    x=(1,2,3)
  a1=A()
  a1.x += (4,) 
  a2=A()
  a2.x != a1.x
is safe, but if x were a list, then a2.x would get the modified value from a1.


Constants
--
Make constants available as attributes of the relevant class.  This makes
objects self-contained and 'batteries-included'.  Otherwise you have to
import the defining module just to use the object.
